Vim Commands
============

Copy is called yank (y), cut is called delete (d), and paste is called put (p).

Copy, Cut, and Paste in Visual Mode (v/V, y/d, P/p)
1 Place the cursor on the line you want to begin copping or cutting.
2 The visual mode has three subtypes.
	Press v to enter the visual mode.
	Press V to enter visual line mode, where the text is selected by line.
	Press Ctrl+v to enter visual block mode. In this mode, the text is selected by rectangle blocks.
	Entering the visual mode also marks a starting selection point.
3 Move the cursor to the end of the text you want to copy or cut. You can use a movement command or up, down, right, and left arrow keys.
4 Press y to copy, or d to cut the selection.
5 Move the cursor to the location where you want to paste the contents.
6 Press P to paste the contents before the cursor, or p to paste it after the cursor.

To copy and paste a chunk of code in Vim follow these instructions;
    Place the cursor on the line you want to begin cutting.
    Press V to select the entire line, or v to select from where your cursor is.
    Move the cursor to the end of what you want to copy, using h,j,k, or l
    Press y to copy it, or d to cut it.
    Place the cursor where you would like to paste your copied stuff.
    Press P to paste it before your cursor, or p to paste it after the cursor.

List tree of changes
:undolist
:earlier, :later, g- and g+ commands
The syntax is as follows.
:earlier {count}	Go to older text state {count} times.
:earlier {N}s		Go to older text state about {N} seconds before.
:earlier {N}m		Go to older text state about {N} minutes before.
:earlier {N}h		Go to older text state about {N} hours before.
:earlier {N}d		Go to older text state about {N} days before.
:later {count}		Go to newer text state {count} times.
:later {N}s		Go to newer text state about {N} seconds later.
:later {N}m		Go to newer text state about {N} minutes later.
:later {N}h		Go to newer text state about {N} hours later.
:later {N}d		Go to newer text state about {N} days later.
g-			Go to older text state.  With a count repeat that many times. 
g+			Go to newer text state.  With a count repeat that many times.

Basic Find and Replace
:[range]s/{pattern}/{string}/[flags] [count]
For example, to search for the first occurrence of the string ‘foo’ in the current line and replace it with ‘bar’, you would use:
:s/foo/bar/
To replace all occurrences of the search pattern in the current line, add the g flag:
:s/foo/bar/g
If you want to search and replace the pattern in the entire file, use the percentage character % as a range. This character indicates a range from the first to the last line of the file:
:%s/foo/bar/g
If the {string} part is omitted, it is considered as an empty string, and the matched pattern is deleted. The following command deletes all instances of the string ‘foo’ in the current line:
:s/foo//g
To ignore case for the search pattern, use the i flag:
:s/Foo/bar/gi

To insert text:
Command 	Insert Text
-------		-----------
If			beginnig of line
i 			before cursor
a 			after cursor
A 			at the end of the line
o 			open a line below the current line
O 			open a line above the current line
r 			replace the current character
R 			replace characters until <ESC>, overwrite

To move the cursor:

You must be in Command Mode to use commands that move the cursor. Each of these commands can be preceded with a Repeat Factor.

Examples:
8j will move the cursor down 8 lines
3w will move the cursor 3 words to the right.
Command 						Moves the cursor
-------							----------------
SPACE, l (el), or right arrow 	space to the right

$ 								end of the line
0 (zero) 						beginning of the line
